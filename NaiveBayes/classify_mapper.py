"""
Mapper for Naive Bayes Inference.
INPUT:
    ID \t true_class \t subject \t body \n
OUTPUT:
    ID \t true_class \t logP(ham|doc) \t logP(spam|doc) \t predicted_class
SUPPLEMENTAL FILE: 
    This script requires a trained Naive Bayes model stored 
    as NBmodel.txt in the current directory. The model should 
    be a tab separated file whose records look like:
        WORD \t ham_count,spam_count,P(word|ham),P(word|spam)
        
Instructions:
    We have loaded the supplemental file and taken the log of 
    each conditional probability in the model. We also provide
    the code to tokenize the input lines for you. Keep in mind 
    that each 'line' of this file represents a unique document 
    that we wish to classify. Fill in the missing code to get
    the probability of each class given the words in the document.
    Remember that you will need to handle the case where you
    encounter a word that is not represented in the model.
