"""
Reducer aggregates word counts by class and emits frequencies.

INPUT:
    partitionKey \t word \t ham_partialCount,spam_partialCount
OUTPUT:
    word \t ham_count,spam_count,P(word|ham),P(word|spam)
    
Instructions:
    Again, you are free to design a solution however you see 
    fit as long as your final model meets our required format
    for the inference job we designed in Question 8. Please
    comment your code clearly and concisely.
    
    A few reminders: 
    1) Don't forget to emit Class Priors (with the right key).
    2) In python2: 3/4 = 0 and 3/float(4) = 0.75
